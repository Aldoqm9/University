It's not talking about being a genius programmer. 
what you should do is not to go off into your cave and type in code and shock the world with your new brilliant new invention. 
Maybe I won't be a genuis,maybe I won't shock the work. at least I won't want them to see my trail of failures and mistakes. But, that will make you bus factor very low as long as your code quality.Don't be afraid of showing your code or sharing your opinions to others.If you're working on programming in any way you should not be doing it all in the cave
Criticism is actually good and the next important thing is that you have to learn to sort of embrace of failure.
Don't just fail, fail quickly and pick up and try someting diffent as fast as you can.
Don't be afraid of admitting your failure 


## nice comment
There is no genius
Lose the ego
Criticism is not evil
Embrace failure
Iterate Quickly
Be a small fish
Be influenced
Be vulnerable
Tools
Involve collaborators early, but not too (at the 'sweet spot')
In other words:

Don't try to be a genius
Collaborate early and often
Pay attention to your tools
Pay attention to timing
