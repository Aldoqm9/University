# Revision
### An essential part for any interview prep. 
Here I have listed the timeline for each topic and the revision time gap which should be maintained so that you are well versed with the topics.
It is based on the pyschology of Spaced repetition (an evidence-based learning technique).

## Table of Contents

- [Data Structures](#Data-Structures)
- [Algorithms ](#Algorithms)
- [Additional Topics](#additional-topics)

> Note:
> - Rep 1 is the Day 1 you start.
> - Rep 2 follows 14 days (2 weeks) from the day you completed the topic and 
> - Rep 3 goes to 35 days (5 weeks) from Rep 2.

## Data Structures

## Additional topics 

| Topic | Rep 1 | Rep 2 | Rep 3 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| ![Recursion](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#recursion) | Day 1 | 2 weeks | 5 weeks |
| ![Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#object-oriented-programming) | Day 1 | 2 weeks | 5 weeks |
| ![String manipulaiton](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#string-searching--manipulations) | Day 1 | 2 weeks | 5 weeks |

Alternatively you can choose ![the topic](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#even-more-knowledge) which you want to study.
Follow the same plan for revision.

I highly recommend while learning these topics you practice it using competitve programming webisites like:
- [HackerRank - Algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms)
- [HackerEarth - Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures)

While revising use :
- [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/)

Many resources are provided [here](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#coding-question-practice) as well.

### Go on and ACE that Interview!
